# Project: SkillSync - AI-Powered Job Readiness Dashboard

## üìÖ Project Timeline: 6-8 Weeks (Part-Time | 3-4 Hrs/Day)

---

## ‚ú® Project Goal

Build an AI-powered platform that helps developers align their learning path and portfolio with the latest job requirements, by comparing parsed job descriptions with their resume, GitHub activity, and self-tracked skills.

* PostgreSQL (or Firebase for rapid MVP)
* REST API
* Celery + Redis (for background jobs)

### NLP + AI

* spaCy (skill extraction)
* Transformers (optional for advanced extraction)
* PDFMiner or PyMuPDF (resume parsing)
* Sentence-BERT (similarity checking)

### Integrations

* GitHub API
* Resume Upload (PDF parser)

## üöÄ Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Week 1-2)

* [ ] User Auth (Firebase or Django)
* [ ] Frontend layout (dashboard + pages)
* [ ] Resume upload + PDF parser
* [ ] JD input + skill extraction (spaCy)
* [ ] Skill comparison basic logic

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-5)

* [ ] GitHub API integration
* [ ] Visual skill map & score
* [ ] Learning plan builder + resource DB
* [ ] Resume scorecard (basic)
* [ ] Save user profiles + state

### Phase 3: UX & Polish (Week 6-7)

* [ ] Dashboard charts + graphs
* [ ] Add/edit custom skills manually
* [ ] Mobile responsiveness
* [ ] Auth tokens, secure uploads

### Phase 4: Extensions & SaaS Layer (Week 8)

* [ ] Admin panel (for bootcamp/coaching use)

## üìä System Design Highlights

* **Microservice-ready:** Resume parsing, JD NLP, and GitHub scraping can be separate services
* **Async jobs:** Scraping, parsing run in background via Celery
* **Secure storage:** Store resumes temporarily, delete after analysis
* **Scalable API:** All functions exposed as REST endpoints

---

## üéì How This Helps You Get Hired

* Shows you can build real **AI-backed, full-stack systems**
* Demonstrates **resume + JD intelligence** skills using NLP
* GitHub integration = proof of **open-source awareness**
* Smart dashboard = **UX thinking** + clean frontend
* Ready to scale into **bootcamp/college SaaS tool**
